# News API

In order to be able to run the app you'll need to setup an account with [news api](https://newsapi.org). You can create a free account.

Then just follow the steps:

1. Get a key from [news api account](https://newsapi.org/account).
2. Create a `.env` file in the project's root folder
3. Add the news api key to the `.env` file like `news_api_key=<YOUR_KEY>`
